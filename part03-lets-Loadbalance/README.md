# Lets LoadBalance
üîñ In kubernetes we have 4 types of networking services:
- ClusterIP -> Only Accessible within the cluster
- NodePort -> Expose the application directly to outside
- LoadBalancer -> Reach the application from ouside (Better security rather than NodePort)
- Ingress Controller -> Route traffic based on different DNS names to different apps

## MetalLB as a LoadBalancer
üîñ This is the solution that im going to use when im deploying kubernetes in local environment.

**NOTE**: When you are using a public cloud like AWS, GCP or Azure you definately dont need this solution.
